    "# Distributed Encoding Protocol for Faster Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distributed Amplitude Encoding (DE)\n",
    "There are two approaches to Quantum Computing, namely Quantum-inspired and Quantum Mechanical, where the latter is known as \"true\" quantum computing. This paradigm was explored in the passage above under QPIXL encoding protocol, which delved into a new manner of implementing FRQI with a linear scalability. As it can be observed, even with a linear scalability, which allows us to have a significantly lower depth compared to RFV and other Amplitude Encoding protocols, we are still unable to encode large images efficiently without use of a preprocessing step, which was the Autoencoder. Hence in this passage, we will look at a new approach which though may not be reliazable with actual hardware, has promise for a much faster simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Distributed Encoder, as the name suggests, relies on a \"Divide and Conquer\" approach, where the image vector (image after being flattened), can be split into chunks of size n, and we can encode each chunk separately using RFV, hence we can encode images as large as 3,840 x 2,160 pixels in a matter of seconds, with log2(n) qubits, and a shallow depth. The process is as follows :\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Import dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Pass image to encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Split image to smaller chunks and normalize each chunk\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Encode each chunk using RawFeatureVector (RFV) PQC\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Simulate each chunk to extract the statevector\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Append all chunks classically together and renormalize\n",

    "By using this approach, imagining a 32 x 32 image, instead of needing a RFV PQC with a depth of 2037 and width of 10, we can use 16 RFV PQCs with depth 121 and width of 6, which allows us to have a much faster simulation. This approach shows itself best as we go higher in resolution (Anything larger than 50 x 50), and thus in circuit volume, and we can see this is perhaps the only manner we can perform the simulated encoding."
