Power-Up plan:
NVIDIA
We would like to apply to the NVIDIA power-up, as we will be attempting to train a full quantum pipeline from encoding to classification. 
This will involve encoding images using either a chunked amplitude embedding, or if time allows, a new pennylane or qiskit implementation of the QPIX framework for FRQI. 
Then an autoencoder pipeline that will feed into a quantum neural network classifier. In parallel to this, we would also like to see if it is possible
to run various transformations on the encoded image and decode the state back into an image, a little bit like quantum photoshop. The NVIDIA power up would greatly help in 
all of the training and simulation tasks.

Amazon
In a similar vein to above, having access to the computational resources afforded by AWS woudl increase our throughput with respect to the training of the various 
subsystems of our project.
